# inSTREAM-Gen-Fishing-version

This is un updated version of the inSTREAM-Gen version described in:

Ayllón, D., Railsback, S.F., Vincenzi, S., Groeneveld, J., Almodóvar, A., and Grimm, V. 2016. 
InSTREAM-Gen: Modelling eco-evolutionary dynamics of trout populations under anthropogenic environmental change. 
Ecological Modelling 326: 36-53.

This updated version implements an improved fishing module to test the effects of different harvest regimes on the eco-evolotionary trajectory of the modelled population.

The NetLogo model is provided in the folder named "NetLogo model".
The folder "Extensions" contains all the NetLogo extensions needed to run the model.
The input files required to run the model are included in the folder "Input files".
Finally, the TRACE document of the model can be found in the folder "Documentation". This document contains a comprehensive description of the model as well as information regarding its parameterization, evaluation (testing and sensitivity analyses) and validation.

Information about how to run the model is provided in the "HOW TO USE IT" section of the "Information" tab.
Note that this model was developed in NetLogo 5.0.4. It will work in most later NetLogo versions, but not in NetLogo 6.0.1 for sure.

IMPORTANT: to run it is necessary that all files provided in the different folders (NetLogo model, input files and extensions) are placed together in the same folder.
